# archfi

Just a simple bash script to install Arch Linux after you have booted on the official Arch Linux install media.

With this script, you can install Arch Linux with 2 lines of code.

This script is maked to install minimum packages (base, grub and optionally os-prober).<br />
But now, you can install or launch archdi (Arch Linux Destop Install) to install and configure desktop packages.<br />
archdi project : https://github.com/MatMoul/archdi
