# archfi

Just a simple bash script to install Arch Linux after you have booted on the official Arch Linux install media.

With this script, you can install Arch Linux with 2 lines of code.

This script is maked to install minimum packages (base, grub and optionally os-prober).
But now, you can install or launch archdi (Arch Linux Destop Install) to install and configure desktop packages.
archdi project : https://github.com/MatMoul/archfi

You can watch the my videos to show how to use it :
